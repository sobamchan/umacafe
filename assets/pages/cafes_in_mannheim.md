There are quite many cafes in Mannheim but not all of them are equaly good like research papers published on big conferences.
To facilitate a life of in-coming coffee fan Mannheimers, we here list of our favorite cafes in the city.

# [AGÁTA Rösterei & Café](https://agata-kaffee.de/)

AGÁTA has two cafes in Mannheim, one behind the main station, one little far from the city center.
Both serve high quality cups and have few options for light vegetarian lunch.

We also sometimes buy our coffee here for home brewing.


# [Kaffeerösterei Lauri](https://lauri-kaffee.de/)

Lauri is also close to the main station, and it's located in my opinion, one of the nicest area in Mannheim.
Although, it's bit pricy, I (Sotaro) also recommend [a donut shop](https://www.thedonutlab.de/) near by.
