Kimba we had for lunch, has nothing to do with coffee.

# Experiment

[Last time](http://sotaro.io/umacafe/2023/02/14/finca-media), either because of the too fine grind size or the amount of water, we didn't get the nice flavor we wanted but too much bitterness. To address that, we kept the amount of water fixed and only changed the grid size from 30 to 45 clicks (always change only one factor in experiments).

# Result

Much better than last time, we can today enjoy the sweetness and nice coffee flavor not hidden by bitterness.

# Conclusion

We are getting used to the procedure, and have a little space in our mind to perform some experiments and modifications now.
