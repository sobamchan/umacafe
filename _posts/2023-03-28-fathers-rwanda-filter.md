# Experiment

Our coffee supervisor brought us this coffee, from a roastery that is one of the most well known one in Europe.
As guidances supervisors provide, this bag of coffee showed us a direction that we need to investigate in future.

# Result

We clearly agreed that this is the best coffee ever since started brewing at our office.
There is no noisy taste but full of fruity sweetness which is hard to find even at cafes.

# Conclusion

Additionally to a fantastic experience by a special flavor of this coffee, it was good for us to try this one of the best options at the moment because we now know more less "what we need to find" in coffee.
