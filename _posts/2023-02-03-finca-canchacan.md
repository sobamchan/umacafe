# Experiment

We kicked off our office coffee journey with [Guatemala Finca Canchacan](https://www.helder-leeuwen.de/Guatemala-Finca-Canchacan-Kaffee/1008211) just because it was in one of our personal kitchen at home.
Since we still do not own a grinder at our office, one of our members grinded at home and bring it to the office, idealy we want to use freshly grinded one to maximize the flavor, leaving this as a future work for now.

This is our main and only proper equipment for our setup, [Hario V60 Switch](https://www.hario-europe.com/products/v60-immersion-dripper-switch). We opted for this option regarding to the comments from our [coffee-supervisor](https://portizs.eu).
But for today, as a first experiment, we didn't perform the Imemersion but just used it as a normal V60.

Since we still don't have anything to receive coffee from the V60, we used a super old looking kettle found at the office kitchen, which worked extremely fine.

We tried to followed [the recipe](https://youtu.be/1oB1oDrDkHM) from [James Hoffmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hoffmann), the coffee influencer on the Internet.

It took around 3 min for brewing, reasonably fast for super busy CS Ph.D. student, we can't enjoy a good conversation during this time since, brewer needs to pay a lot of attention but still a good meditation time so later we can fully concentrate on our work.

This is a photo of a machine we have at the office, it's free, fast and convenient, though we appreciate this one a lot, we decided to go deeper into the fancy coffee world.


# Result

We're fairly satisfied with our first hand brewed coffee, even performed side-by-side comparison with the one from the machine.
Our coffee was very clear, smooth, almost no noisy flavor we used to get from the machine.
It could have been better perhaps with corser grid size to emphasize the acidity and sweetness.

# Conclusion

Very good, requires some experiments, better to have a glass server so we can also study the color of the liquid.
