Winter in Germany is dark and cold, making people wondering what to do at home.
I watched enough Anime on Netflix and random videos on YouTube, after work, waiting for few hours to have dinner and sleep doing pretty much nothing.

And just remember that with a colleague at office, we purchased a little tool called [Hario Switch](https://www.hario-europe.com/products/v60-immersion-dripper-switch) which would let us make a tasty cup of coffee at office from locally roasted coffee at our beautify city of Mannheim.
Personally, when I start investing some time on one topic, I like making a website or note to log how it goes as there are several pages on my personal website, about [travel](https://sotaro.io/travel), [coffee](https://sotaro.io/coffee) or [books](https://sotaro.io/reading).
So I decided to also make one for our journey at "coffee at office".

For a CS Ph.D. student, it requires just a little bit of time (though required some stupid debuggings) to build a website like this using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
With this website setup, we can keep updating on our office coffee time hoping that we can host researchers who like coffee to visit us to talk about nerdy things with a cup of coffee.
