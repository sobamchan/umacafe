We celebrated Valentine's Day with limited edition coffee from our favorite coffee shop has a cute package which doesn't really fit into computer science lab.
I thought that I set grider's click to 30 as last time but turned out that coffee was too fine for immersion, resulting to produce strong/bitter taste.

It was very helpful to have a measuring cup to receive cofffee from Hario Switch.

Even from the coffee color, it looks quite dark.

Although the unexpected bitter taste, it was still fine, let's just put it as "that's how love tastes like sometimes".

# Conclusion

We learned how the love sometimes tastes like on Valentine's Day, let's just call it a day.
