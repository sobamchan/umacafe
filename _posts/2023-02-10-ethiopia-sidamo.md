When you think you're geting use to do something, you need to be careful, in those mind status, it's easy to make mistakes, like we didn't boil enough water to brew a good cup of coffee.

Anyway, despite of this mistake, the coffee this time was still good.

# Result

So far, everytime we try making coffee with different type of beans, I personally like [our second one](http://sotaro.io/umacafe/2023/02/03/finca-canchacan) the most.
